#1 Creating a Project
To create a new project on GCP, we need to follow these steps:
1. Log in to the GCP console and click on the "Select a project" dropdown on the top navigation bar.
2. Click on the "New Project" button and enter a name for your project.
3. Choose a billing account and click on the "Create" button.

Output: After creating a project, we will get a Project ID, which we will use throughout this infrastructure.

CODE:
gcloud projects create <project-name> --set-as-default
