#10 Deploying and Monitoring

To deploy and monitor the platform, we will use a continuous integration and deployment tool to automate the deployment process and use a monitoring tool to monitor the application for performance issues and errors. 
Output:
After deploying and monitoring, the platform will be fully functional and ready to provide a music crowdfunding experience for fans and artists.

Here are the steps:
1. Use a CI/CD tool like Cloud Build to automate the deployment process.

An example Cloud Build configuration file for deploying the platform using Docker:


steps:
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  args: ['build', '-t', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/<image_name>', '.']
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  args: ['push', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/<image_name>']
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/kubectl'
  args: ['apply', '-f', 'k8s/']
  
  
Replace <image_name> with the name of your Docker image and k8s/ with the path to your Kubernetes deployment files.


2. Use a monitoring tool like Stackdriver to monitor the application for performance issues and errors.
