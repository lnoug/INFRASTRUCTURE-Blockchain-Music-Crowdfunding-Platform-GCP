#10 Deploying and Monitoring

To deploy and monitor the platform, we will use a continuous integration and deployment tool to automate the deployment process and use a monitoring tool to monitor the application for performance issues and errors. 
Output:
After deploying and monitoring, the platform will be fully functional and ready to provide a music crowdfunding experience for fans and artists.

Here are the steps:
1. Use a CI/CD tool like Cloud Build to automate the deployment process.

An example Cloud Build configuration file for deploying the platform using Docker:


steps:
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  args: ['build', '-t', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/<image_name>', '.']
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  args: ['push', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/<image_name>']
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/kubectl'
  args: ['apply', '-f', 'k8s/']
  
  
Replace <image_name> with the name of your Docker image and k8s/ with the path to your Kubernetes deployment files. (For Kubernetes and Docker img check my "#10 (Bonus)" file)


2. Use a monitoring tool like Stackdriver to monitor the application for performance issues and errors.

Use Stackdriver to monitor your Kubernetes deployment and application.
To monitor your Kubernetes deployment with Stackdriver, you can follow these general steps:

Install the Stackdriver agent: Install the Stackdriver agent on your Kubernetes nodes to collect metrics and logs from your application and infrastructure.

    Configure Stackdriver Kubernetes Engine Monitoring: Enable Stackdriver Kubernetes Engine Monitoring to collect additional metrics and metadata about your Kubernetes deployment.
    
        Create a Stackdriver dashboard: Use the Stackdriver dashboard editor to create a custom dashboard that displays the metrics and logs you want to monitor. You can add charts, tables, and other widgets to present the data in a meaningful way.
        
                Set up alerts and notifications: Configure Stackdriver to send alerts and notifications when certain thresholds are exceeded or when specific events occur. You can receive alerts via email, SMS, or other channels.
                
By monitoring your Kubernetes deployment and application with Stackdriver, you can identify issues early, troubleshoot problems quickly, and optimize performance.
