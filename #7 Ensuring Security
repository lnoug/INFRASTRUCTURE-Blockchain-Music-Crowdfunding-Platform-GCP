#7 Ensuring Security
To ensure security, we will use encryption and secure servers to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. 
Output: 
After ensuring security, user data will be protected and unauthorized access will be prevented.


Here are the steps:

1. Use the following command to create an SSL certificate:

gcloud compute ssl-certificates create <certificate-name> \
--certificate <certificate-file> \
--private-key <key-file>


Replace <certificate-name>, <certificate-file>, and <key-file> with actual values.

2. Configure your web server to use HTTPS and the SSL certificate.

Here is an example Nginx configuration file for using HTTPS:


server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name example.com;
  ssl_certificate /path/to/cert;
  ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key;
  location / {
    # handle requests here
  }
}
