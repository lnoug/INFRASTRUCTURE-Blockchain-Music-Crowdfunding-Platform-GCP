#9 Generating Revenue
To generate revenue, we will use transaction fees and partnerships with music-related companies. 

Output: After generating revenue, artists will be able to pay for the services they use, and the platform will be able to partner with music-related companies to generate additional revenue.

Here are the steps:
1. Use the following command to set up transaction fees using the Stripe API:

Stripe.charges.create({
  amount: <amount>,
  currency: <currency>,
  source: <source>,
  description: <description>
});

Replace <amount>, <currency>, <source>, and <description> with actual values.


# Here is an example Python code for creating a charge using the Stripe API:

import stripe

stripe.api_key = "<your_stripe_secret_key>"

charge = stripe.Charge.create(
    amount=5000,
    currency="usd",
    source="tok_visa",
    description="Charge for music project funding"
)

print(charge)


Use partnerships with music-related companies to generate revenue by providing a seamless and efficient music crowdfunding experience for fans and artists.
